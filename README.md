# Web Scraping Wuzzuf Jobs

## Introduction
This project is a web scraping script written in Python using the BeautifulSoup library to extract job information from [Wuzzuf](https://wuzzuf.net/). The script targets jobs related to machine learning, data analysis, data science, and business intelligence. It gathers details such as job titles, companies, occupations, specifications, and links.

## Getting Started
To run the web scraping script, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
   ```
   !pip install requests
   !pip install bs4
   ```
4. Open the "Web Scraping 'Wuzzuf'.py" file in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
5. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the web scraping script.

## Functions

### `number_of_pages(jobName)`
This function calculates the number of pages to scrape based on the total number of jobs related to the specified job name.

### `scrap(num_pages, url, job)`
This function performs the scraping of job information from multiple pages. It collects data such as job titles, companies, occupations, specifications, and links.

## Scraped Data
The script iterates through the specified job titles ('machine learning', 'data analysis', 'data science', 'business intelligence'), retrieves information from each job page, and creates a DataFrame. The combined DataFrame is then displayed and saved as a CSV file named "JobScraping.csv."
